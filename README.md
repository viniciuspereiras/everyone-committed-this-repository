# Everyone committed this repository
Yes, everyone committed this repository.
# What is?
I got a lot of people to commit and make changes to this repository.
GIT was created for software versioning and GitHub is a platform that supports this versioning using GIT.
Within the GIT in a local repository, you can configure your username and e-mail in each of the commits, in order to control each change. (Go to your repository and a git log!)
So once these changes are pushed to GitHub, Github for some reason takes this email and username information and links it to valid platform users so I can get Linus Torvalds to commit to that repository (without him even having idea of who I am :/ ).
# Exploitation
Within this exploration I used this feature of linking valid users and a way to get emails from users inside commits.
I made a python script to clone large repositories and extract valid usernames and emails, then it makes several local changes and finally pushes it to the repository.
The impact of this is to give credibility to repositories by having many important people or people "commit" to them.
I will report this issue to GitHub Team.
